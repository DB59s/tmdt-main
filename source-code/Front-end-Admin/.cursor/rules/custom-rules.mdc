Architecture and Routing
Project is built with Next.js using App Router and folder-based routing
The app directory is the main container for all routes and components
Routes follow Next.js App Router conventions with special route groups
Directory Organization
/app/(auth): Contains authentication-related routes and pages
Includes auth and pages subdirectories
Contains a layout.jsx for auth-specific layouts
/app/(defaults): Contains all main application routes
Each subdirectory directly corresponds to a route
Example: /app/(defaults)/manage-products â†’ localhost:8080/manage-products
/components: Contains UI components organized by feature/route
Components should be modular and reusable where possible
/styles: Contains project-wide CSS files and styling utilities
Component Structure
Use functional components with TypeScript
Group related components in feature-specific directories
Follow component hierarchy that matches the routing structure
Create specialized components for each route as needed
Development Standards
Use TypeScript for type safety
Implement responsive design with appropriate breakpoints
Follow Next.js best practices for data fetching and rendering
Organize imports logically and minimize dependencies between components
